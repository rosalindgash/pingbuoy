- Created secure logging system that redacts sensitive credentials

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/service-auth.ts` (created)
- `src/lib/secure-logger.ts` (created)
- Environment variable configuration

**Impact:** Eliminated risk of complete database compromise

---

### 2. Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Multiple authentication bypass paths in API routes and middleware.

**Fixes:**
- Fixed missing authentication in 8 API routes
- Implemented comprehensive auth middleware
- Added session validation and CSRF protection

---

### 3. SQL Injection via Regex Bypass (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** PostgreSQL RLS policies used regex that could be bypassed with URL encoding.

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Before (vulnerable):
lower(url) ~ lower(requested_domain)

-- After (secure):
(
  url = requested_domain OR
  url = requested_domain || '/' OR
  url = 'https://' || requested_domain OR
  url = 'https://' || requested_domain || '/' OR
  url = 'http://' || requested_domain OR
  url = 'http://' || requested_domain || '/'
)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/*_fix_public_status_rls.sql`

**Impact:** Prevented SQL injection and unauthorized data access

---
