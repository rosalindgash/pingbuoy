- **Container Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management capabilities

### 10. Development Security (2025)
- **Security Linting**: ESLint security plugins with 2025 rule sets
- **Pre-deployment Security Checks**: Comprehensive security validation
- **Dependency Review**: GitHub dependency review for PRs
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Advanced semantic code analysis
- **Cloud Security Validation**: Pre-deployment misconfiguration prevention

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@pingbuoy.com
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for response and patching

## Security Checklist for Deployment

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] CORS origins are set to production domains only
- [ ] Database access is properly restricted
- [ ] Security headers are correctly applied
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured for your environment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting is set up
- [ ] Backups are encrypted and tested
- [ ] Access logs are being collected
- [ ] Security scanning is running in CI/CD

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Account Security:
- Use a strong, unique password (12+ characters)
- Enable two-factor authentication (MFA)
- Don't share your account credentials
- Log out from shared computers
- Report suspicious activity immediately

### For Website Monitoring:
- Only monitor websites you own or have permission to monitor
- Use HTTPS URLs whenever possible
- Regularly review your monitored sites
- Keep contact information up to date for alerts

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Inform affected users within 72 hours
4. **Remediation**: Apply fixes and security updates
5. **Review**: Conduct post-incident analysis
6. **Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent recurrence

## Compliance

This application implements security measures aligned with:

- OWASP Application Security Guidelines
- GDPR Privacy Requirements
- SOC 2 Type II Controls
- Industry Standard Security Practices

## Security Updates

Security updates are prioritized and deployed as follows:

- **Critical**: Within 24 hours
- **High**: Within 72 hours  
- **Medium**: Within 1 week
