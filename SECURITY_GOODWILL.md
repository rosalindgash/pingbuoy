- ‚úÖ **Expiration Date**: Valid through 2026-12-31
- ‚úÖ **Canonical URL**: Authoritative location reference
- ‚úÖ **Security Policy**: Link to detailed security policy
- ‚úÖ **Scope Definition**: Clear testing boundaries and guidelines
- ‚úÖ **Response Times**: Expected timelines for security responses
- ‚úÖ **Recognition Program**: Acknowledgment for security contributions

**Content**:
```
Contact: security@pingbuoy.com
Contact: https://pingbuoy.com/contact
Expires: 2026-12-31T23:59:59.000Z
Acknowledgments: https://pingbuoy.com/security/acknowledgments
Preferred-Languages: en
Canonical: https://pingbuoy.com/.well-known/security.txt
Policy: https://pingbuoy.com/security/policy
Hiring: https://pingbuoy.com/careers
```

### 2. Change Password Endpoint (RFC 8615)

**Location**: `src/app/.well-known/change-password/route.ts`

Helps password managers and browsers automatically direct users to password change functionality.

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Redirect**: Redirects to `/dashboard/settings/password`
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Methods**: Supports both GET and POST requests
- ‚úÖ **Proper Caching**: 24-hour cache for performance
- ‚úÖ **Standards Compliant**: Follows W3C Change Password URL specification

**Usage**:
- Password managers can automatically find the change password page
- Browsers can suggest password changes after breach notifications
- Users get consistent password change experience

### 3. Contact Information Endpoint

**Location**: `src/app/.well-known/contact/route.ts`

Provides machine-readable contact information for automated tools and services.

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Structured Data**: JSON format with multiple contact categories
- ‚úÖ **CORS Enabled**: Accessible from external tools and services
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Contacts**: General, security, support, and business contacts
- ‚úÖ **Social Media**: Links to official social media accounts
- ‚úÖ **Business Information**: Company details and address

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "contact": {
    "email": ["hello@pingbuoy.com", "info@pingbuoy.com"],
    "web": ["https://pingbuoy.com/contact"]
  },
  "security": {
    "email": ["security@pingbuoy.com"],
    "policy": "https://pingbuoy.com/security/policy",
    "expires": "2026-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"
  },
  "support": {
    "email": ["support@pingbuoy.com"],
    "hours": "Monday-Friday 9:00-17:00",
    "timezone": "UTC"
  },
  "business": {
    "name": "PingBuoy",
    "website": "https://pingbuoy.com",
    "address": { "country": "United States" }
  }
}
```

## üîß Technical Integration

### WAF Configuration

The WAF middleware has been updated to allow `.well-known` paths:

```typescript
const skipPaths = [
  '/api/health',
  '/api/webhooks',
  '/_next/',
  '/favicon.ico',
  '/.well-known/' // Allow RFC 5785 well-known URIs
]
```

### Security Considerations

1. **No Sensitive Data**: Contact endpoints only expose public information
2. **Rate Limiting**: Standard rate limiting applies to prevent abuse
3. **CORS Policy**: Contact endpoint allows cross-origin requests for tools
4. **Caching**: Appropriate cache headers for performance and freshness

## üéØ Benefits

### For Security Researchers

- **Clear Contact Method**: Easy to find security contact information
- **Defined Scope**: Clear boundaries for security testing
- **Response Expectations**: Known timelines for vulnerability reports
- **Recognition Program**: Public acknowledgment for contributions

### For Users

- **Password Management**: Better integration with password managers
- **Security Transparency**: Visible commitment to security
- **Contact Options**: Multiple ways to reach support
- **Trust Building**: Professional security posture

### For Automated Tools

- **Machine Readable**: Structured data for automated processing
- **Standard Compliance**: Follows established RFCs and standards
- **API Integration**: Easy integration with security tools
- **Monitoring Support**: Contact info for uptime monitoring services

## üìä Standards Compliance

### RFC 9116 - Security.txt
- ‚úÖ Required fields: Contact, Expires
- ‚úÖ Recommended fields: Canonical, Policy, Acknowledgments
- ‚úÖ Proper location: `/.well-known/security.txt`
- ‚úÖ UTF-8 encoding and plain text format

### RFC 8615 - Well-Known URIs
- ‚úÖ Proper `.well-known` directory structure
- ‚úÖ Standard URI paths for common resources
- ‚úÖ Appropriate HTTP methods and status codes

### W3C Change Password URL
- ‚úÖ Redirects to application-specific password change page
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- ‚úÖ Provides appropriate HTTP status codes

## üîç Validation

All endpoints can be validated using:

```bash
# Test security.txt
curl https://pingbuoy.com/.well-known/security.txt

# Test change password redirect
curl -I https://pingbuoy.com/.well-known/change-password

# Test contact information
curl https://pingbuoy.com/.well-known/contact
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- **Security Reports**: Number of security vulnerabilities reported
- **Contact Usage**: Requests to contact endpoints
- **Password Changes**: Redirects from change-password endpoint
- **Tool Integration**: Usage by security tools and password managers

### Success Indicators
- **Faster Vulnerability Reports**: Researchers find contact info quickly
- **Reduced Support Tickets**: Clear contact categories reduce misdirected requests
- **Better User Experience**: Password managers work seamlessly
- **Professional Recognition**: Listed in security researcher tools

## üöÄ Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
- Files are automatically deployed with Next.js application
- No additional server configuration required
- Works with Vercel, Netlify, and other static hosts

### DNS Requirements
None - all endpoints work with existing domain configuration.

### SSL/HTTPS
- All endpoints require HTTPS for security
- Browsers and tools expect encrypted connections
- Automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS recommended

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- **Annual Review**: Update expiration dates and contact information
- **Contact Verification**: Ensure all contact methods remain active
- **Policy Updates**: Keep security policy links current
- **Tool Testing**: Verify password manager and security tool integration

### Security Monitoring
- **Abuse Detection**: Monitor for excessive requests to endpoints
- **Content Integrity**: Ensure security.txt hasn't been tampered with
- **Response Testing**: Verify contact methods work correctly
